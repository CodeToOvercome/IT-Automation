# IT-Automation

During my time with Dialpad, I have worked on various scripts to automate onboarding & offboarding tasks.With their permission I have made them available public for educational purposes and to help other fellow IT colleagues.

## G-Suite

Using [GAM](https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3), I have put together scripts that have automated several tasks with G-Suite.

You can find them [here](https://github.com/deepanudaiyar/G-Suite)

## OKTA & Jamf

Scripts to deprovision users in OKTA & to lock a device using JAMF API can be found [here](https://github.com/deepanudaiyar/Misc).

## Dialpad
